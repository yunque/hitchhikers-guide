You've finished your wonderful web prototpe for the Data Fest, your model is awesome and that visualizaiton is going to blow everyone's minds... You get on stage for a live demo and open the webapp only to find that nothing works. Spooky.

To prevent that from happening, it's important to write tests. Think about it, when you write a function, when do you know *it works*™? You probably test it against some ad hoc inputs and, if you get the proper result, you move on. Maybe your function *does* indeed work today, but what if in the following weeks you change a few lines of the function to make it faster, but you don't want to spend time testing again (*it works*™)? Maybe you just introduced a bug and didn't notice.

For that reason, it's important to write automated tests to check your code and make sure that everything
*works consistently*, and that you can identify bugs introduced by future changes.

This tutorial is divided in three parts. The first one addresses *unit testing*, which is a simple 
(but powerful) form of testing. The second part is devoted specifically to testing Data Science pipelines.

The last section covers *Continuous Integration* (or CI). CI is a technique to automatically run all of 
your tests every time you push new code to Github. CI is language-agnostic, but our tutorial specifically
addresses Python, because it is the language we use the most.
